# wp-plugin-init-devtools

This repository is added as a subtree in the `.dev` directory of [48design/wp-plugin-init](https://github.com/48design/wp-plugin-init), to make the dev scripts updateable from each plugin initialised with it. See the [README](https://github.com/48design/wp-plugin-init/blob/main/README.md) over there for use.
